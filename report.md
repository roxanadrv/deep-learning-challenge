# Neural Network Model Report for Alphabet Soup

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to develop a deep learning model that could help Alphabet Soup, a philanthropic organization, predict the success of funded projects. By analyzing historical data from more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding, the model aims to identify patterns and characteristics that lead to a successful use of the funds. This enables Alphabet Soup to allocate resources more effectively, supporting initiatives with the highest likelihood of making a significant impact.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- **Target Variable(s):**
  - The target variable for this model is `IS_SUCCESSFUL`, indicating whether the funding was used effectively by the recipient.

- **Feature Variables:**
  - Features include variables such as `APPLICATION_TYPE`, `AFFILIATION`, `CLASSIFICATION`, `USE_CASE`, `ORGANIZATION`, `STATUS`, `INCOME_AMT`, `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`, and `ASK_AMT`. These provide insights into the type, status, financial classification, and intentions of the organizations applying for funding.

- **Variables Removed:**
  - `EIN` and `NAME` were removed from the input data. These columns are identifiers for the organizations and do not contribute to the predictive model's effectiveness.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- **Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions:**
  - The neural network model consisted of two hidden layers. The first layer contained 80 neurons and the second layer 30 neurons, both using the ReLU activation function. The output layer used a sigmoid activation function to provide a probability output for the binary classification task.
  - The choice of neurons and layers aimed to strike a balance between model complexity and computational efficiency. ReLU was chosen for its ability to handle non-linearity and its efficiency in training, while sigmoid was selected for the output layer due to its suitability for binary classification tasks.

- **Target Model Performance:**
  - The initial model performance goal was set ambitively above 75% accuracy, a benchmark that reflects a strong predictive capability for Alphabet Soup's funding success evaluations. Despite utilizing a neural network architecture with 80 and 30 neurons in its hidden layers, this benchmark proved challenging to meet. The initial configurations, while laying a solid foundation for predictive modeling, did not achieve the aspirational target accuracy out of the gate.

## Optimization Attempts

Efforts to optimize the model involved several strategies, each aimed at overcoming limitations and enhancing accuracy:

- **Model Architecture Adjustments**: Increased neurons in layers and added layers did not substantially increase accuracy. Experiments with different activation functions, such as LeakyReLU, were also explored.
- **Training Adjustments**: Variations in batch sizes, epochs, and optimizers, including Adam and SGD, were tested alongside implementing callbacks like `EarlyStopping` and `ModelCheckpoint`. The learning rate was carefully adjusted to find an optimal balance.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Increased dropout and L2 regularization were applied to combat overfitting. Despite these efforts, significant accuracy improvements were elusive.


### Summary

The developed neural network model demonstrated promising results in predicting the success of funded projects for Alphabet Soup. However, the target accuracy of 75% remained unattained despite exhaustive optimization attempts. These efforts underscored the challenges in tuning deep learning models and the complexities of the dataset.

As a recommendation for further exploration, considering alternative models such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) or Random Forest could offer different insights and possibly improve prediction accuracy. These models can handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features differently than neural networks, which might prove beneficial depending on the underlying patterns of the data. Additionally, ensemble methods that combine predictions from multiple models could also be explored to enhance predictive performance.
