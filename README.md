# Alphabet Soup Charity Success Prediction

## Overview

This project involves the development of a neural network model to predict the success of projects funded by Alphabet Soup, a philanthropic organization. By analyzing historical data from over 34,000 organizations that received funding, the model aims to identify patterns that indicate whether a funded project will be successful. This tool assists Alphabet Soup in allocating resources to projects with the highest likelihood of impactful outcomes.

## Project Objectives

- To preprocess the data for the neural network model, including encoding categorical variables, splitting the dataset, and standardizing the features.
- To design, compile, train, and evaluate a neural network model that predicts the success of funded projects.
- To optimize the model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

## File Descriptions

- `charity_data.csv`: The dataset containing historical data on organizations funded by Alphabet Soup.
- `AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the preprocessing, model training, and initial evaluation steps.
- `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook dedicated to model optimization efforts.
- `AlphabetSoupCharity.h5`: The HDF5 file containing the trained model.
- `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5`: The HDF5 file containing the optimized model.
- `report.md`: A detailed report on the neural network model's performance and analysis.
